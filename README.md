Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript.

We created a few sound effect buttons with a simple javascript array and when clicked would play a sound. Pretty simple project but we got to use forEach and look at HTML5's audio API which was a first, pretty cool, but simple project.
